### What is this repository for? ###

Phone/doorbell answering machine, because I can't phone.

### How do I get set up? ###

* heroku deployment, NR to ping and keep alive.
* Get a Twilio account
* I have now set this up to do almost nothing during development or test, so no texts fire off during le testing, we all love getting Twilio text messages.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Test locally using ngrok? Twilio can be set to send GET or POST requests for most things, check the meta method in helper.rb and the code . . .
* Generally push to master, or to your feature branch? #yolo

### Who do I talk to? ###

* [amassaad](https://github.com/amassaad)
